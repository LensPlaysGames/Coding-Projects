    "Composition 604 (7578895) is a wonderful, powerful pyrotechnic flash powder created by Gary Chen, Mark Motyka, and Jay C. Poret for the US Army as a perchlorate-free flashbang replacement for use in M115A2 and M116A1 hand grenade simulators during training. One gram of the stuff is enough to take fingers. The best part about this composition is it's simplicity, flexibility, as well as safety. The ingredients listed are just one variation. Oxidizer can be any of KNO3, Sr(NO3)2, or basic copper nitrate, ranging from 45-60%. Metallic fuel can be any powder of Al, Mg, Mg/Al, Si, and Zr, ranging from 35-45%. Non-mettalic fuel is sulfur, ranging from 0-15%. pH buffer is boric acid, ranging from 0.5-1.5%. This buffer prevents forming amides between the nitrates and metals (effectively reducing agents in this scenario), which is exothermic and could ignite the mixture. A ballistic accelerant may be used to improve the brissance of the material, which can be any of nitrocellulose, black powder, or a propellant, ranging from 0-10%. 0-5% diatomaceous earth (fine SiO2) can be used as an anti-caking/free-flow agent."

The addition of Al creates a higher temperature flame, as well as a more consistent burn rate (no more spitting). 7 meters of cotton string is prepared, as well as 15g fuse composition. The composition is wet with 75:25 water to isopropanol until a thick slurry texture is reached (like a thick milkshake). The string is wet until fully saturated. The string is then put into the slurry and mixed around for a few minutes, ensuring an even coat and a good soak. The string is then removed from the slurry and set out to dry in the sun (DO NOT HEAT). After a day or three, your fuse is ready! Makes a killer quick-match when enclosed in a paper tube, although rolling Al foil around it also does the job. NC lacquer mixed with black powder can be used to seal the fuse."

Not the fuse for me, personally. Without dextrin it is a crumbly mess that falls apart and could never work. Dextrin pushes it into a 'usable' area, but only if nothing else was available."

However, it is not reliable (goes out on its own), as well as having the issue of what I call 'creeping'. It doesn't burn evenly, it burns a section really fast, then smolders for a while, then burns a whole section, then smolders, making timing anything with this fuse impossible. I've had three inch sections go nearly instantly, and I've had two inch fuses that go out e very few millimeters. Definitely important to keep dry, or it just won't work at all. Works in a pinch, and much better than regular black match, but definitely leaves things to be desired in the fuse department. Made by dissolving composition in equal weight boiling water, then boiling cotton string in the water until the composition crystalizes onto the string. Once the pan is getting dry, remove from heat and lay string out on a baking sheet. Bake at 150 degrees C for 20 minutes to fully dry the fuse. It is now ready to ignite!"
