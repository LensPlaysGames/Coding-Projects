THIS SCRIPT DOWNLOADS IMAGES TO THE DIRECTORY IT IS IN (using Thread Pooling to Speed Up the Process)
ALSO TIMES THE TOTAL DURATION OF TIME SPENT DOWNLOADING AND LOGS IT TO duration.csv IF should_time IS TRUE
DOWNLOADS IMAGES AND WRITES DURATION iterations AMOUNT OF TIMES FOR EASY AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION

Thanks to Corey Schafer for the Great YouTube Tutorial and the Image Urls!
