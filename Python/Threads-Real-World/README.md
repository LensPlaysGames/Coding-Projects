# Download Images *With Threads*
A Basic Python Script to Download some Images from Unsplash either very quickly (using threads), or very slowly (wihout using threads)
I wrote script this as a way to help myself understand the time that can be saved using threads vs 'regular' programming

Uses concurrent.futures and it's wonderful ThreadPoolExecutor to manage threads
